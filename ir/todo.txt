=======

 - I: cell "throw new Error(...)" is not durable => redundant updates
 - E: element constructors are not memoizable (cannot appear twice in DOM tree)
 - rop: Open -> Call; Update -> Result; Close -> Drop
 - rop: place updaters as inputs to "GW" cell, not root
 - rop: use new serialization described in rop.md
 - rop: pass thunks & use remotely
 - rop: do not kill server when WS client disconnects
 - rop: protect against malicious peers
 - rop: on shutdown, close observers
 - server: use button in browser(s) to increment a counter
 - grid: repeating background?
 - grid: demo vertical & horizontal scrolling
 - demo: Demo needn't/shoudn't be `posn: abs`
 - demo: provide buttons for un-render / re-render
 - eventDemo/dragStream: capture vs. document listener
 - I: drop cell after no users *and* no creator
 - Revisit comments with TBO (To-Be-Optimized)
