=======

 - I: overhaul
    - report Pending error cleanly when returned by root cell inputs
      (simplify client.js)
    - No error when root deps return non-null; error on invalidate!
    - usePending -> catchPending?
 - E: element constructors are not memoizable (cannot appear twice in DOM tree)
 - rop: Open -> Call; Update -> Result; Close -> Drop
 - rop: place updaters as inputs to "GW" cell, not root
 - rop: use new serialization described in rop.md
 - rop: pass thunks & use remotely
 - do not kill server when WS client disconnects
 - rop: protect against malicious peers
 - use button in browser(s) to increment the counter
 - rop: on shutdown, close observers
 - I: deal with leaks (see below)
 - grid: repeating background?
 - grid: demo vertical & horizontal scrolling
 - drag: leverage `listen` from e.js?
 - demo: Demo needn't/shoudn't be `posn: abs`
 - demo: provide buttons for un-render / re-render
 - eventDemo/dragStream: capture vs. document listener
 - Validate "clean" install using "npm update"
 - Revisit comments with TBO (To-Be-Optimized)
 - I: cell.deactivate() & `use()` in the root context: While effective, it
   is conceptually ugly.  The code calling `use` cannot be recalced, and the
   `deactivate` implementation sticks out like a sore thumb.
- I: drop cell after no users *and* no creator
